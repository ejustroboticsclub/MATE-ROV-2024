# Length Estimation Software

This software is designed to help users estimate the length of objects by creating and manipulating rectangles on images.

## Instructions

### Preparing Images

1. Place your photos in a folder named "date" beside the main.py file.

### Creating and Manipulating Rectangles

1. Press **N** to start creating a rectangle (rectangle start point). Press **N** again to set the rectangle endpoint.
2. Drag and drop the rectangle using the mouse or use the arrow keys to move it.
3. Use the following keys to manipulate the rectangle:
   - Press **P** to print the width and height of the current rectangle.
   - Press **A** to decrease the rectangle's width.
   - Press **D** to increase the rectangle's width.
   - Press **S** to decrease the rectangle's height.
   - Press **W** to increase the rectangle's height.
   - Press **Q** to rotate the rectangle clockwise.
   - Press **E** to rotate the rectangle anti-clockwise.
4. On the rectangle with a known length, write its length in cm (After this, the real length for all other rectangles will be calculated and displayed when printing).
